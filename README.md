# Ant-n-Seeds
A computer simulation solution of Project Euler Problem 280 "Ant and seeds"

## Introduction
A training exercise to develop knowledge of Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Community Edition 2015 and the Csharp programming language.

Brute force approach:  run a series of simulations, and in each run keep track of total number of moves required to move all the seeds to their final position.  When all the simulations are complete, find the average of the total moves from each run and display result.
