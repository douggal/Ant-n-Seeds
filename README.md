# Ant-n-Seeds
A computer simulation solution of Project Euler Problem 280 "Ant and seeds"

A training exercise to develop knowledge of Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Community Edition 2015 and the Csharp programming language.

Brute force approach:  run a set of simulations keeping track of number of moves required to move all the seeds to their final position.  When all the simulations have been run, find the average number of moves and display result.
